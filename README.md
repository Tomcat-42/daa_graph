# Graph Algorithms Comparison

This repository contains the implementation and comparison of two renowned graph algorithms: Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. The project serves as an analytical platform to compare these algorithms, applying and verifying concepts associated with graph traversal and minimum spanning trees.

## Objective

The primary aim of this project is to run and compare the behavior of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms based on:

1. Execution time
2. Number of comparisons

We will analyze these metrics under various scenarios, providing a comprehensive view of the performance characteristics of these algorithms.

## Implementation Details

- You may choose the programming language for the implementation.
- The algorithms should be implemented considering the standard rules for Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
- The input data will be graph representations, with non-repeating integers as node values.
- The approach of implementation should be consistent for both algorithms.
- Input data for the algorithms should be based on provided files, with the graph representation defined in the file format `GraphN.txt`.
  - (Insert link to datasets here)
- The values to be used for algorithm runs are available in the same link in the format `RunN.txt`.

## Evaluation Criteria

The performance of the algorithms will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. During the algorithm run:

   - Chronological time spent on executing both algorithms.
   - Number of key comparisons made during each algorithm run.
